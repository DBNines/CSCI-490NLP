You are expected to attend class regularly to catch up on syllabus, homework and projects. While there is no direct penalty for not attending, you might fall behind and struggle with homework/project/exam. But, you should stay home if you are ill. You should inform your Head TA of any illness or situation that will affect the submission of an assignment or the ability to take an exam. Only your Head TA can excuse a student from a course requirement or responsibility. When conflicts can be anticipated, such as for many University-sponsored activities and religious observations, you should inform your Head TA of the situation as far in advance as possible. For unanticipated or emergency conflict, when advance notification to your Head TA is not possible, you should contact your Head TA as soon as possible by email. When the student is unable to make direct contact with the Head TA and is unable to leave word with the instructor's department because of circumstances beyond the student's control, and in cases of bereavement, quarantine, or isolation, the student or the student's representative should contact the Office of the Dean of Students via email or phone at 765-494-1747. Our course Brightspace includes a link on Attendance and Grief Absence policies under the University Policies menu. In order to ensure efficient communication, please reach out via email. When sending a message, include your course name and a clear subject. It will help address your questions promptly. I aim to respond to messages within 24–48 hours during weekdays. Messages sent over the weekend or holidays may receive a response the following business day. For questions that benefit the entire class, consider posting in the designated course discussion board instead of messaging privately. If you have any question/concern regarding grading, contact TA keeping me in CC.
